# California Wildfires

Exploratory data analysis using Python (Pandas) on CalFire dataset with ~2,000 observations. The aims of this project were to investigate/visualize trends and relationships on all reported incidents of California wildfires between 1969-2021, and more specifically analyze when these fires are at their worst. We also observed that the number of fires in a year did *not* coincide with fire severity (acres burned in a single year).
